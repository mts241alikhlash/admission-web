# 241 Admission Web

The Vue 3 + Vite frontend for **241 Admission** — admission waves,

school platform.

Shared UI and utilities come from the published `@mts241alikhlash/ui` and
`@mts241alikhlash/web-shared` packages (GitHub Packages) — never copied or
vendored.

pnpm install
pnpm run dev         # http://localhost:5175
pnpm run validate    # format:check + lint + typecheck + lint:strict + test + build
```
